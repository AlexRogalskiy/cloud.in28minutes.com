## EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)
- In corporate data centers, applications are deployed to physical servers
- Where do you deploy applications in the cloud?
	- Rent virtual servers
	- **EC2 instances** - Virtual servers in AWS (billed by second)
	- **EC2 service** - Provision EC2 instances or virtual servers

## EC2 Features
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ec2instances.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/elb.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ebs.png)
- Create and manage lifecycle of EC2 instances
- **Load balancing** and **auto scaling** for multiple EC2 instances
- **Attach storage** (& network storage) to your EC2 instances
- Manage **network connectivity** for an EC2 instance

## EC2 Instance Types
- Optimized combination of **compute(CPU, GPU), memory, disk (storage) and networking** for specific workloads
- 270+ instances across 40+ instance types for different workloads
- **t2.micro**:
	- **t** - Instance Family
	- **2** - generation. Improvements with each generation.
	- **micro** - size.  *(nano < micro < small < medium < large < xlarge < .....)*
- (Remember) As size increases, compute(CPU, GPU), memory and networking capabilities increase proportionately

## EC2 - Instance Metadata Service and Dynamic Data
##### Instance Metadata Service:
- Get details about EC2 instance **from inside** an EC2 instance: 
	- AMI ID, storage devices, DNS hostname, instance id, instance type, security groups, IP addresses etc
- URL: **http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/**
- URL Paths: network, ami-id, hostname, local-hostname, local-ipv4 , public-hostname, public-ipv4, security-groups, placement/availability-zone

##### Dynamic Data Service:
- Get dynamic information about EC2 instance:
- URL: **http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/**
- Example: http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document

## EC2 Security Groups
![](./images/aws/00-icons/user.png)
![](./images/arrowbi.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/securitygroup.png)
![](./images/arrowbi.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ec2instance.png)

- **Virtual firewall** to control **incoming and outgoing** traffic to/from AWS resources (EC2 instances, databases etc)
- Provides additional layer of security - Defense in Depth

## Security Groups Rules
![](./images/aws/security-group-example.png)
- Security groups are **default deny**
	- If there are no rules configured, no outbound/inbound traffic is allowed
- You can specify **allow rules ONLY**
- You can configure **separate rules** for inbound and outbound traffic
- You can assign multiple (upto five) security groups to your EC2 instances
- You can add and delete security groups to EC2 instances at any time. 
	- Changes are immediately effective
- Traffic NOT explicitly allowed by Security Group **will not reach** the EC2 instance
- Security Groups are **stateful**:
	- If an outgoing request is allowed, the incoming response for it is automatically allowed. 
	- If an incoming request is allowed, an outgoing response for it is automatically allowed

## EC2 Security Group - Trivia
- What if there are no security group rules configured for inbound and outbound?
	- Default DENY. No traffic is allowed in and out of EC2 instance.
- Can I change security groups at runtime?
	- Yes. Changes are immediately effective.

## EC2 IP Addresses 
- Public IP addresses are internet addressable. 
- Private IP addresses are **internal** to a corporate network
- You CANNOT have two resources with same public IP address. 
- HOWEVER, two different corporate networks CAN have resources with same private IP address
- **All EC2 instances** are assigned private IP addresses
- Creation of public IP addresses **can be enabled** for EC2 instances in public subnet
- (Remember) When you stop an EC2 instance, public IP address is lost
 

## Elastic IP Addresses
- Scenario : How do you get a **constant public IP address** for a EC2 instance?
	- Quick and dirty way is to **use an Elastic IP**!
- Elastic IP can be switched to another EC2 instance **within the same region**
- Elastic IP **remains attached** even if you stop the instance. You have to manually detach it. 
- Remember : You are charged for an Elastic IP when you are NOT using it! Make sure that you explicitly release an Elastic IP when you are not using it
- You will be charged for Elastic IP when:
	- Elastic IP is NOT associated with an EC2 instance OR
	- EC2 instance associated with Elastic IP is stopped
 
## Bootstrapping with Userdata

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document > /var/www/html/index.html
```

- **Bootstrapping**: Install OS patches or software when an EC2 instance is launched. 
- In EC2, you can configure **userdata** to bootstrap
- Lookup user data - http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/ 

## Launch Templates
- Why do you need to specify all the EC2 instance details (AMI ID, instance type, and network settings) **every time** you launch an instance?
- How about creating a **Launch Template**?
- Allow you to launch Spot instances and Spot fleets as well
- **DEMO** - Launch EC2 instances using Launch Templates

## Reducing Launch Time with Customized AMI
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ec2instance.png)
![](./images/arrow.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ami.png)
![](./images/arrow.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ec2instances.png)

- Installing OS patches and software using userdata at launch of EC2 instances **increases boot up** time
- How about creating customized AMIs with OS patches and software **pre-installed**?
	- **Hardening an Image** - Customize EC2 images to your corporate security standards
- **Prefer** using Customized AMI to userdata
- **DEMO** : Create a Customized AMI and using it in Launch Template

## AMI - Amazon Machine Image
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ami.png)
![](./images/arrow.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ec2instances.png)
- What operating system and what software do you want on the instance?
- Three AMI sources:
	- Provided by AWS
	- **AWS Market Place**: Online store for customized AMIs. Per hour billing
	- **Customized AMIs**: Created by you.

## EC2 Amazon Machine Image - AMI - Remember
- AMIs contain: 
	- Root volume block storage (OS and applications)
	- Block device mappings for non-root volumes
- You can configure launch permissions on an AMI
	- Who can use the AMI?
	- You can **share your AMIs** with other AWS accounts
- AMIs are stored in Amazon S3 (**region specific**). 
- **Best Practice**: Backup upto date AMIs in multiple regions
	- Critical for Disaster Recovery

## EC2 Security - Key Pairs
- EC2 uses public key cryptography for protecting login credentials
- Key pair - public key and a private key
	- Public key is stored in EC2 instance
	- Private key is stored by customer

## Connecting to EC2 instance(s) - Troubleshooting
- You need to have the **private key** with you
- Change permissions to **0400** (*chmod 400 /path/my-key-pair.pem*)
	- Default permissions on private key - 0777 (**VERY OPEN**)
- (Windows Instances) In addition to private key, you need admin password
	- (At Launch) Random admin password is generated and encrypted using public key
	- Decrypt the password using the private key and use it to login via RDP
- Security Group should allow inbound SSH or RDP access:
	- Port 22 - Linux EC2 instance (SSH)
	- Port 3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop - Windows)
- Connect to your instance using its Public DNS: `ec2-**-**-**-**.compute.amazonaws.com`

## Important EC2 Certification Scenarios and Questions
| Scenario |Solution  |
|--|--|
|You want to identify all instances belonging to a project, to an environment or to a specific billing type|Add Tags. Project - A. Environment - Dev|
|You want to change instance type| Stop the instance. <BR/>Use "Change Instance Type" to change and restart.|
|You don't want an EC2 instance to be automatically terminated| Turn on Termination Protection. <BR/>(Remember) EC2 Termination Protection is not effective for terminations from a) Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) b) Spot Instances c) OS Shutdown|
| You want to update the EC2 instance to a new AMI updated with latest patches | Relaunch a new instance with an updated AMI|
| Create EC2 instances based on on-premise Virtual Machine (VM) images| Use VM Import/Export. You are responsible for licenses.|
|Change security group on an EC2 instance|Assign at launch or runtime. Security Group changes are immediately effective.|
|You get a timeout while accessing an EC2 instance|Check your Security Group configuration|
|You are installing a lot of software using user data slowing down instance launch. How to make it faster? |Create an AMI from the EC2 instance and use it for launching new instances|
|I've stopped my EC2 instance. Will I be billed for it?| ZERO charge for a stopped instance (If you have storage attached, you have to pay for storage) |

## Quick Review of EC2 for AWS Certification

##### AMI 
- What operating system and what software do you want on the instance? 
- Reduce boot time and improve security by creating customized hardened AMIs. 
- Region specific. 
- Backup AMIs in multiple regions. 
- You can share AMIs with other AWS accounts.

##### EC2 Instance Types 
- Optimized combination of compute(CPU, GPU), memory, disk (storage) and networking for specific workloads.

##### Security Groups 
- Virtual firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic to/from AWS resources (EC2 instances, databases etc)
- Default deny. Separate allow rules for inbound and outbound traffic
- Stateful and immediately effective

##### Key Pairs
- Public key cryptography (Key Pairs) used to protect your EC2 instances
- You need private key with right permissions (chmod 400) to connect to your EC2 instance. (Windows EC2 instances only) You need admin password also.
- Security group should allow SSH(22) or RDP(3389)

##### EC2 - Things to Remember
- **Instance Metadata Service** - Get details about EC2 instance from inside an EC2 instance.  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
- **Userdata** -  Used for bootstrapping. Install OS patches or software when an EC2 instance is launched.
- **Elastic IP Addresses** - Static public IP address for EC2 instance. 
- **Launch Templates** - Pre-configured templates (AMI ID, instance type, and network settings) simplifying the creation of EC2 instances.
