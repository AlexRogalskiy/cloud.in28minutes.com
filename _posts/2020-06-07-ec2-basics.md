## EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)
- In corporate data centers, applications are deployed to physical servers
- Where do you deploy applications in the cloud?
	- Rent virtual servers
	- **EC2 instances** - Virtual servers in AWS (billed by second)
	- **EC2 service** - Provision EC2 instances or virtual servers

## EC2 Features

![](./images/aws/00-icons/elb.png)
![](./images/aws/00-icons/ebs.png)
- Create and manage lifecycle of EC2 instances
- **Load balancing** and **auto scaling** for multiple EC2 instances
- **Attach storage** (& network storage) to your EC2 instances
- Manage **network connectivity** for an EC2 instance

## EC2 Instance Types
- Optimized combination of **compute(CPU, GPU), memory, disk (storage) and networking** for specific workloads
- 270+ instances across 40+ instance types for different workloads
- **t2.micro**:
	- **t** - Instance Family
	- **2** - generation. Improvements with each generation.
	- **micro** - size.  *(nano < micro < small < medium < large < xlarge < .....)*
- (Remember) As size increases, compute(CPU, GPU), memory and networking capabilities increase proportionately

## EC2 - Instance Metadata Service and Dynamic Data
##### Instance Metadata Service:
- Get details about EC2 instance **from inside** an EC2 instance: 
	- AMI ID, storage devices, DNS hostname, instance id, instance type, security groups, IP addresses etc
- URL: **http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/**
- URL Paths: network, ami-id, hostname, local-hostname, local-ipv4 , public-hostname, public-ipv4, security-groups, placement/availability-zone

##### Dynamic Data Service:
- Get dynamic information about EC2 instance:
- URL: **http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/**
- Example: http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document

## EC2 Security Groups

- **Virtual firewall** to control **incoming and outgoing** traffic to/from AWS resources (EC2 instances, databases etc)
- Provides additional layer of security - Defense in Depth

## Security Groups Rules
![](./images/aws/security-group-example.png)
- Security groups are **default deny**
	- If there are no rules configured, no outbound/inbound traffic is allowed
- You can specify **allow rules ONLY**
- You can configure **separate rules** for inbound and outbound traffic
- You can assign multiple (upto five) security groups to your EC2 instances
- You can add and delete security groups to EC2 instances at any time. 
	- Changes are immediately effective
- Traffic NOT explicitly allowed by Security Group **will not reach** the EC2 instance
- Security Groups are **stateful**:
	- If an outgoing request is allowed, the incoming response for it is automatically allowed. 
	- If an incoming request is allowed, an outgoing response for it is automatically allowed

## EC2 Security Group - Trivia
- What if there are no security group rules configured for inbound and outbound?
	- Default DENY. No traffic is allowed in and out of EC2 instance.
- Can I change security groups at runtime?
	- Yes. Changes are immediately effective.

## EC2 IP Addresses 
- Public IP addresses are internet addressable. 
- Private IP addresses are **internal** to a corporate network
- You CANNOT have two resources with same public IP address. 
- HOWEVER, two different corporate networks CAN have resources with same private IP address
- **All EC2 instances** are assigned private IP addresses
- Creation of public IP addresses **can be enabled** for EC2 instances in public subnet
- (Remember) When you stop an EC2 instance, public IP address is lost
 

## Elastic IP Addresses
- Scenario : How do you get a **constant public IP address** for a EC2 instance?
	- Quick and dirty way is to **use an Elastic IP**!
- Elastic IP can be switched to another EC2 instance **within the same region**
- Elastic IP **remains attached** even if you stop the instance. You have to manually detach it. 
- Remember : You are charged for an Elastic IP when you are NOT using it! Make sure that you explicitly release an Elastic IP when you are not using it
- You will be charged for Elastic IP when:
	- Elastic IP is NOT associated with an EC2 instance OR
	- EC2 instance associated with Elastic IP is stopped
